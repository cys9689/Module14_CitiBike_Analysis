# Project Overview 
This module was focusing on data visullization by using the software- Tableau. Tableau software is an American interactive data visulization softwared with mapping functionality- able to plot latitude and longitude coordinates and coordinates and connect to spatial files like KML, GeoJson to display custom geography. In addition, the goal of this project is convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. So we want to format our story so it's persuasive! We'll also want to include information about both New York City and Des Moinesâ€”after all, the investors will need to understand how the Citi Bike data for New York City applies to our proposal.


# Background
The moment has come to put together the final presentation for the investors. You've asked your data a lot of questions: the who, what, where, and how long. The Citi Bike data is ready to help you tell a story, but it's up to you and the team to deliver a compelling story. Your final deliverable might look different from a peer's deliverable, and that's okay.

- To craft this narrative for the investors, you'll do the following:
* Select your questions. During this step, you'll consider which results you want to share with your audience. What do they want to see? How can we use that information to make their decision making process easier?
* Execute independent research. You'll need to look at other relevant pieces of information to build a bigger picture. Search other sources to find information that will make your visualization more powerful.
* Craft your Tableau story. This is when you create your story, primarily from worksheets and other visuals, with descriptions for each of them.
* Create a written analysis. The written analysis is intended to provide additional insight into what we're trying to convey to our audience. This is a good place to add extra detail so that everyone can get on the same page.

# Objectives 

* Display data professionally and accurately.
* Professionally style a Tableau story.
* Utilize previously created Tableau worksheets to create a new story.
* Create a Tableau story based on starting a bike-sharing company in Des Moines.

# Challenge Summary:
This module start from creating sheet to Dashboard to Story. Eventually, we had analyze the data analysis from **201908-citibike-tripdata.csv** and transfer into individual visullization plots. The csv file contains the data of Bicycle-share in New York city. And we are trying to implement the same system in a different city- Des Monies (Iowa). By doing that ,we had compare the population, sex and age, income. To see whether having the system in Des Monies is possible. we had make the conclusion and the detail finding in citibike_analysis.md file.
